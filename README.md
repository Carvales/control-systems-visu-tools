# Control Systems Visualisation Tools

## Description
This repository is intended for :
- Control System students who need to experience stuff in order to learn.
- Control System professors who want to include visual, practical and pedagogical elements in their lectures.

MATLAB applications (designed with appdesigner) are proposed to visualize and understand dynamical systems.

## Available tools:

- Design and Visualisation of PID Regulator

Note : Available tools are functional but can still evolve (add features, bug corrections, etc.)

## Tools planned:
- MCC Control
- Path Planning : Attractive / Repulsive Field
- About MPC

## Prerequisites
